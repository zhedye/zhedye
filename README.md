### Howdy Partner ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on a puzzle game about recursion.

I am learning a lot of cool stuff in school about distributed systems and algorithms.

If you are interested in video games it would be fun to do a game jam with you.

How to reach me: send a pull request on my repos.

Pronouns: ze/zer

Fun fact: I can do windmills.
